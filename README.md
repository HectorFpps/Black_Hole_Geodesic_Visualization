🚀 Black Hole Geodesic Visualization: A 2D Black Hole Simulator with PyGame

This project is a cool visualization that shows what happens when light rays (photons) get close to a black hole in the Schwarzschild solution. It simulates the bizarre effects of gravity so strong it warps space itself, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing.

✨ What Does It Do?

Bending Light: Watch the light rays curve dramatically as they approach the massive black hole, demonstrating how gravity bends light.

Infinite Trails: Each photon leaves a permanent trail, drawing the exact path it took through the warped space.


The Point of No Return: We clearly mark the Event Horizon (the black hole's boundary). Once light crosses this red line, it's trapped forever!
